### Project Overview

#### Problem

The original system used by Scrib Library was inefficient and outdated. It relied on manual records and spreadsheets , which made it difficult for library staff to maintain accurate inventory, track books, and quickly locate resources. This manual system was prone to errors, time-consuming, and lacked the flexibility needed for a thriving community hub. This led to frustration for both staff members and patrons , hindering the library's mission to provide easy access to information and resources.

Specifically, the library struggled with:

* **Inaccurate Inventory**: Manual data entry led to discrepancies between recorded inventory and the actual books on the shelves.
* **Time-Consuming Process**: Updating records, searching for books, and generating reports were all labor-intensive.
* **Limited Accessibility**: The initial system was not easily accessible to all staff members, hindering collaboration.
* **Lack of Search Functionality**: Finding a specific book required a slow and inefficient manual search through physical records.

#### Solution

A robust and scalable web-based Library Management System (LMS) was developed to streamline book inventory and user management processes.

**Key Features**:

* **Book Cataloging & Search**: Allows users to filter and search by title, ISBN, or author.
* **Role-Based Access Control**: Provides different access levels for administrators and librarians.
* **Automated Book Availability Indicator**: Indicates if a book is available or not at a glance.
* **Author Management**: Functionality to add and edit authors.
* **Authentication and Authorization**: A secure login for both admins and librarians, with approval-based authorization.
* **Intuitive UI/UX**: The system was designed using best practice UX principles.

#### Steps

1.  **Planning and Documentation**: Outlined the database requirements, designed the database, and identified key milestones and project requirements.
2.  **Design**: The Database Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was designed using MS Visio, a main sitemap was created, and wireframes were made for necessary pages.
3.  **Implementation/Build**: The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS, while the backend was built with PHP and MYSQL.
4.  **Testing**: Bugs were fixed based on user feedback.
